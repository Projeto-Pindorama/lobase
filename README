lobase
======

lobase is a port of the OpenBSD userland to Linux.

Caution
-------

There are subtle differences in GNU coreutils and the OpenBSD userland,
replacing coreutils on Linux system without caution will result in
issues with varying impact.

If you build your own linux system from the ground up and you know that
your scripts are all portable you can use lobase as main coreutils.

Otherwise I suggest to use a prefixed installation and adding lobase to
your users shell `PATH`.

Installation
------------

	$ autoreconf -fi
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install

To speed up the compilation use multiple make jobs:

	$ MAKE_JOBS=$(cat /proc/cpuinfo|grep processor|wc -l)
	$ make -j"$MAKE_JOBS"
	# make -j"$MAKE_JOBS" install


Prefix Installation
-------------------

You can install lobase into its own prefix and then use the `PATH`
environment variable to prefer lobases binaries over the default
coreutils for your users shell.

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/lobase

Build and install lobase and then add lobases bin and sbin directories
to your path.
To make this permanent, set `PATH` in your shell profile.

	$ PATH=/usr/local/lobase/bin:/usr/local/lobase/sbin:$PATH

Simple test to verify that lobase is used:

	$ which which
	/usr/local/lobase/bin/which

Thanks for Nan Xiao for the port of tcpbench(1); Leah Neukirchen for porting
some utils @ obase; Duncaen for porting the most @ lobase.
